If you have an AFFLIB distribution file (e.g. afflib-3.2.1.tar.gz), then
you can install this file with:

    # build configure if it is not present
    if [ ! -e configure ]; sh bootstrap.sh ; fi
    # run configure
    ./configure && make && make install


To disable optimization, do this:

      ./configure 'CXXFLAGS=-O0 -g' 'CFLAGS=-O0 -g'

Optimization is automatically disabled if the environment variable
AFF_NOOPT is set.

If you are trying to compile out of a git or SVN repository, then you
need to run autoconf to create the configure script and other
tempaltes. We have provided a script called "./bootstrap.sh" that will
do this for you.
